# ToDo-Gen
Need a to do list?  Here is a Python script that will write it for you!  

* Latest Release: v1.01  

## Requirements  
You can feel free to use it on Python 3.5 and up, how ever it has only been tested on 3.6.6.  I don't know what will happen if you try it on a 2.x.x version.  

## How to use
You can use by opening up command prompt, (or powershell which should work the same), cd to the directory that the main.py file is in, and type the following command:  

```
python main.py
or if on Linux/macOS with Python 3.x.x installed:
python3 main.py
```  
  
## Known Issues  
It is known that the script doesn't work on Ubuntu.  
Recently, a bug on Linux and Mac was fixed that called errors upon importing specific os modules.
